# Mongo DB Backup and Restore

Shell script for backing up and Restoring Mongo Databases on a given server.  
You can have your Mongo Database backed up and compressed in a directory created automatically in this repository root.

## Configuration

In order to make this code work for you, the first thing you must to do is to make a copy of the `.env.example` file in the repository root. The name of this new file has to be just `.env`.
After that, get into the file and fill all the enviroment variables with your own access data.
The way you have to do that is described bellow with more details.

## Backup Defaults (in the .env file)

	HOST
	* Example: localhost or cluster0.0000.gcp.mongodb.net

	PORT
	* Example: 27017

	BACKUP_CONNECTION_STRING
	* Example: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.0000.gcp.mongodb.net

	BACKUP_DB_NAME
	* Example: "users"


## Restore Defaults (also in the .env file)

	RESTORE_CONNECTION_STRING
	* This may be empty in case you are not using username and password;
	* This may be the same as the BACKUP_CONNECTION_STRING if you want to restore the data at the original source;
	* This may be another connection string in case you whant to send the data to another Database like a DB migration for example.
	
	RESTORE_DB_NAME
	* Format: yyyy-mm-dd
	* In the `Backups` folder created automatically in this repository source there must exist a sub-directory named with that date.


## Lounching the backup

Once it you configured correctly the `.env` file, at the root of this repository, all you need to do is louch the backup by typing that command in the shell: `./backup.sh` and after that, if your configs are right, you should see the backup running in the shell.
IMPORTANT: the command must to be executed in the root folder of this repository.

## Script Output

As the code runs, some messages will be printed in the shell. Since the initial steps until the success or error in the end.

## Restoring from Backup

Restore a backup using the `./restore.sh` command in the shell also in this repository root.
IMPORTANT: Before using that command don't forget to fill correctly the `.env` file variables:
	
	RESTORE_CONNECTION_STRING
	RESTORE_DATE
	RESTORE_DB_NAME

That restore command uses the mongorestore command from Mongo DB tools.
	
	mongorestore [options] [directory or filename to restore from]
